## Hero Realms Lua Lessons
Welcome, you successfully navigated your way to the Lua Lessons repository! Here, you can snag yourself some example Lua script files to use in your journey to make awesome Lua content in Hero Realms. 

Each lesson published on my page [iSlayWardens](https://islaywardens.com/tag/lua-lesson/), will contain a file here that follows along with the tutorial lesson. You can download the files from this repository or fork this one so you have your own versions to have and can get updates as I publish more.

I hope these lessons have helped you in some way.
